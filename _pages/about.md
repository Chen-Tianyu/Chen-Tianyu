<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student majoring in Information and Computing Science at **Beijing Jiaotong University**. Now I am working as a research intern at **Microsoft** under the guidance of Principal Researcher <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/juding/">Dr. Justin Ding</a>.
Previously, I was working at **Peking University** under the supervision of <a href="https://wanxiaojun.github.io/">Prof. Xiaojun Wan</a>.

As a student with a multidisciplinary background in mathematics and artificial intelligence, strong foundations in research and leadership roles, I am keen on exploring opportunities that can deepen my understanding of Generative AI.

[DSGram: Dynamic Weighting Sub-Metrics for Grammartical Error Correction in the Era of Large Language Models]()

**Jinxiang Xie**, Yilin Li, Xunjian Yin, Xiaojun Wan

[**Project**](https://github.com/jxtse/GEC_Metrics_LLM) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> | <a href="">Link to paper</a>
- We introduce new sub-metrics for GEC evaluation, diverging from previous categorical approaches.
- We propose a novel dynamic weighting-based GEC evaluation method, DSGram, which integrates the Analytic Hierarchy Process with large language models to ascertain the relative importance of different evaluation criteria.
- We present two datasets: DSGram-Eval, created through human scoring, and DSGram-LLMs, a larger dataset designed to simulate human scoring for fine-tuning.
