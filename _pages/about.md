<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student majoring in Information and Computing Science at **Beijing Jiaotong University**. Currently, I am working as a research intern at **Microsoft** under the guidance of Principal Researcher <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/juding/">Justin Ding</a>.
Prior to this, I conducted research at **Peking University** under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://wanxiaojun.github.io/">Xiaojun Wan</a>.

I have been offered admission to the graduate program at Nanjing University for Fall 2025, providing me with a valuable window to further immerse myself in research. **I am actively seeking research assistant opportunities in areas such as LLMs applications, AI for biology, unstructured natural language processing to deepen my understanding of Generative AI**.

DSGram: Dynamic Weighting Sub-Metrics for Grammartical Error Correction in the Era of Large Language Models

- **Jinxiang Xie**, Yilin Li, Xunjian Yin, Xiaojun Wan<!-- , AAAI 2025 -->

<!-- [**Project**](https://github.com/jxtse/GEC_Metrics_LLM) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> | <a href="">Link to paper</a> -->
<!-- - We introduce new sub-metrics for GEC evaluation.
- We propose a novel dynamic weighting method, which integrates the Analytic Hierarchy Process with large language models to ascertain the relative importance of different evaluation criteria.
- We present two datasets: DSGram-Eval, created through human scoring, and DSGram-LLMs, a larger dataset designed to simulate human scoring for fine-tuning. -->
