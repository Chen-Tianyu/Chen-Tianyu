<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a 3rd-year undergraduate student majoring in Information and Computing Science at Beijing Jiaotong University. I previously worked with <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/ctank/"> Prof. Colin Tan</a> and<a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/boyd/"> Prof. Boyd Anderson</a> in the Summer Workshop at **National University of Singapore**. Now I am a research intern at **Peking University** under the supervision of <a href="https://wanxiaojun.github.io/">Prof. Xiaojun Wan</a>.

As a student with a multidisciplinary background in Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, strong foundations in research and leadership roles, I am keen on exploring opportunities that can deepen my understanding of Generative AI.

I am actively seeking MPhil or PhD programs where I can use my expertise for technological advancement, integrating AI into real-world applications.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

[**Project**](https://github.com/jxtse/GEC_Metrics_LLM) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Proposed a novel dynamic weighting evaluation method using automated analytic hierarchy process.
- Integrated LLMs to simulate human scoring to make models closer to human feedback, labeled a dataset with more than
1,000 scoring.
- Verified the consistency of the dataset with human feedback, and fine-tuned a low-cost lightweight model.
